# MiniMessageAnywhere

A Paper 1.16.5+ Plugin which allows you to use full-featured json text in anywhere you want. This is done by component
processing at protocol level. Take an advantage of translatable components, rgb text, gradients, click and hover events.

## Features

- Parse mini message anywhere! Chat, Titles, Scoreboard, Boss bars, Entities, Items and many more other places. Simply
  put [mm]<message>[/mm] in any plugin's config.
- Global placeholders! You can define placeholders to use globally on the server.
- Chat filtering to avoid json-text player abuse.
- Configurable transformations.
